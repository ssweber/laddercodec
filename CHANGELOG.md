# Changelog

<!-- Style guide: one sentence per entry. Describe the user-visible effect, not the
     implementation. Group related fixes/features into a single entry when they share
     a theme. Breaking changes and migration steps can be longer — users need the
     specifics. Detail belongs in commit messages and PR descriptions, not here.

     Review and condense before release — entries accumulate during development and
     should be edited into shape before moving from Unreleased to a version heading. -->

## Unreleased

### Added
- **CSV writer**: `write_csv(path, rungs, index=True)` emits 1-based sequential rung markers (`R1`, `R2`, `R3`, …) instead of plain `R`; readers accept `R` optionally followed by digits, so indexed files still round-trip.

### Performance
- `decode_program()` is ~48% faster — topology block scanning uses `bytes.find()` instead of byte-by-byte iteration, and hot loops cache `len(data)` and precomputed constants.
- `encode()` is ~35% faster — cell headers use a single pre-compiled `struct.Struct.pack` instead of 8 separate calls, and Math blobs use pre-computed empty slot bytes instead of 1000 per-instruction loop iterations.

## 0.1.8

### Fixed
- **CSV writer**: downgrade trailing blank row mismatch from error to warning
  when a tall instruction's stripped continuation absorbs extra blank rows on
  read-back — fixes `WriterError` on rungs with blank rows beyond an
  instruction's visual height

## 0.1.7

### Fixed
- **SCR decode**: skip pure vertical pass-through rows in implied modifier
  row fallback, preventing `|` → `T` and blank → `-` corruption on
  continuation rows
- **CSV converter**: recognize `Contact`/`CompareContact` objects with
  `wire_down=True` during wire hydration, not just bare string tokens

### Changed
- **SCR decode**: remove `_implied_modifier_row_offsets` fallback — SCR
  continuation row topology already encodes per-row horizontal connectivity
  explicitly, verified across 883 rungs in 47 SCR files

## 0.1.6

### Fixed
- **SCR decode**: replace backward/brute-force topology block scanning with a
  single forward pass, fixing false positive matches from flag-table tail bytes
  that caused spurious empty rungs with inflated row counts

## 0.1.5

### Changed
- **Encode**: remove AF summary block — Click accepts multi-AF rungs without
  it, eliminating complex gating logic
- **CSV**: consolidate tall-instruction padding into shared hydrate/dehydrate
  helpers in converter and writer

### Added
- **Devtools**: `combine_coverage.py` — combine random coverage fixtures into
  a single multi-row rung for paste smoke-testing
- **Devtools**: `coverage_golden.py` now regenerates all bins unconditionally

## 0.1.4

### Fixed
- **CSV**: preserve multi-row AF round-trips, including pinned/tall AF blocks
  away from row 0, multiple tall blocks in one rung, and generic tall
  continuation rows
- **SCR decode**: restore omitted wiring for generic tall AF continuation rows
- **CSV writer**: fail loudly when emitted CSV rows lose decoded rung
  semantics by reparsing writer output and checking for row, condition, or AF
  mismatches before writing to disk

## 0.1.3

### Fixed
- **RTF decode**: parse RTF comments structurally instead of regex-based
  stripping, handling nested groups, font/color tables, and style toggles
  correctly
- **RTF decode**: handle `\uN` unicode escape sequences (signed 16-bit) and
  validate `ansicpg1252` before decoding
- **CSV**: preserve quoted string literals in AF token positional args — e.g.
  `copy("d",TXT1)` no longer loses its quotes during parse
- **Search instruction**: store text-search operands with quotes end-to-end,
  removing the strip-on-decode/re-add-on-encode anti-pattern

### Added
- **Encode**: auto-sanitize non-ASCII characters (curly quotes, em-dashes,
  arrows, etc.) in rung comments before RTF conversion via NFKD normalization


## 0.1.2

### Fixed
- **Math**: preserve duplicate operands and normalize parenthesis spacing

## 0.1.1

### Fixed
- **Encode**: correct `row_span` for tall AF instructions and single-rung list
  routing

## 0.1.0

Initial release. Originally prototyped in
[clicknick](https://github.com/ssweber/clicknick), then developed into a
standalone library here.

- Encode `Rung` objects or CSV into Click clipboard binary
- Decode clipboard binary back into structured Python objects
- Decode `Scr*.tmp` program files into `Program` objects
- All standard Click instruction types supported natively
- `RawInstruction` passthrough for unknown blob types
- Zero runtime dependencies
