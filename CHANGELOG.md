# Changelog

## 0.1.3

### Fixed
- **RTF decode**: parse RTF comments structurally instead of regex-based
  stripping, handling nested groups, font/color tables, and style toggles
  correctly
- **RTF decode**: handle `\uN` unicode escape sequences (signed 16-bit) and
  validate `ansicpg1252` before decoding
- **CSV**: preserve quoted string literals in AF token positional args — e.g.
  `copy("d",TXT1)` no longer loses its quotes during parse
- **Search instruction**: store text-search operands with quotes end-to-end,
  removing the strip-on-decode/re-add-on-encode anti-pattern

### Added
- **Encode**: auto-sanitize non-ASCII characters (curly quotes, em-dashes,
  arrows, etc.) in rung comments before RTF conversion via NFKD normalization


## 0.1.2

### Fixed
- **Math**: preserve duplicate operands and normalize parenthesis spacing

## 0.1.1

### Fixed
- **Encode**: correct `row_span` for tall AF instructions and single-rung list
  routing

## 0.1.0
