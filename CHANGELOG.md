## Unreleased

### Fixed
- **Math encode**: formulas are written the way Click's editor writes them (`ABS ( x )`, `RAND ( a , b )` in its infix internal form, range interiors listed), so pasted ABS and RAND formulas no longer raise a Math instruction error in CLICK v4.
- **Coil decode**: an Out coil with a func code laddercodec does not know falls through to `raw(Out,...)` instead of silently decoding as a plain `out(...)`.
- **Drum decode**: a drum with an unknown base decodes as `raw(Drum,...)`. Before, a CLICK v4 Time & Event drum with an event on every step decoded as a plain `time_drum` with its events as presets.
- **Raw multi-part instructions**: a `raw(...)` token with part count 2+ rebuilds Click's part bytes (`01 02 03` for a drum, not `00 01 02`), so `write_csv` no longer fails its round-trip check on raw drums and SCR raw blobs carry the right bytes.
- **Drum encode**: with Jump off, Jog takes the func code Jump would have, as CLICK writes it, so CLICK v4's syntax check no longer rejects a pasted drum with C000A ("all inputs of the box instruction must originate from the same branch").
- **CSV read, OR inputs on boxes**: OR legs under any timer, counter, shift or drum input now push its later pins down, so a `count_down` fed by a 3+ row OR no longer fails with "count_down requires a .reset() pin row", and a retentive timer fed by a 2+ row OR keeps its `.reset()` instead of encoding as non-retentive.
- **CSV writer**: a box's empty pin rows stay in place when a floating blank-AF row or a `count_down` follows it, and a `count_down` under a blank-AF row keeps its own empty top row, where `write_csv` used to fail its round-trip check.

### Changed
- **CSV read**: a blank-AF row directly under `count_down` is an OR leg of its Down input, not the bridge row, and a pin a timer does not have (e.g. `.down()`) raises `ConvertError` instead of being read as a blank row.

### Added
- **Pin OR legs**: OR legs under a counter, shift or drum pin push the later pins down and grow the box as CLICK does, read from and written to the blob's part bytes (`pin_rows`) in clipboard and SCR, with an unused pin's row below the legs above it; pins out of order or repeated raise `ConvertError` instead of being dropped, and `write_csv` refuses a leg drawn onto an unused pin's row, which CSV cannot express.
- **CLICK v4 check**: `find_v4_only(rungs)` lists the instructions an older CLICK would silently change on paste (Break/Continue, Out variants, time & event drums, time drums with a duration from a register, v4 math functions and SUM over bits), and `is_v4_only()` checks one.
- **CLICK v4 Break and Continue**: `break()` and `continue()` decode and encode as `Break` and `Continue`, exported from the root package. Before, both decoded as `next()`. Click-written blobs re-encode byte for byte.
- **CLICK v4 Time & Event drum**: `time_event_drum(outputs=[...],presets=[1000,None,DS1],events=[None,C1,C2],unit=Tms,...)` decodes and encodes as `Drum(drum_kind="time_event")`, with the same `.reset()` / `.jump()` / `.jog()` pin rows as the other drums. `None` marks a step without a preset or event. Click-written drums re-encode field for field.
- **CLICK v4 Out variants**: `toggle(C1)`, `toggle(immediate(Y1))`, `debounce(...)`, `flasher(...)` and `timed(...)` decode and encode as `OutVariant`, exported from the root package. Each phase names its accumulator and preset (`on_acc=TD1,on_preset=100`); timed takes `maintained=1`. Click-written blobs re-encode byte for byte.
- **CLICK v4 capture fixtures**: math aggregates (MAX/MIN/MDN/AVG, SUM over bits, ABS, RAND) decode to the token in each rung's comment, and Click-written math blobs match the encoder field for field.

## 0.2.2 (2026-09-10)

### Fixed
- **SCR decode**: parse counted column widths, independent display flags, and all stored rows so valid populated special rows no longer trigger recovery, and malformed records fail without silently skipping a rung.
- **SCR decode**: preserve branch wiring above a later rail-connected row instead of deleting the branch and shifting the lower wire upward.

### Added
- **Native drum regression fixtures**: preserve the original NOP's wire row and a branch above it after row insertion and drum placement, with native SCR/clipboard and CSV comparisons.

### Documentation
- Correct SCR flag meanings and fixture provenance, and distinguish native persisted flags from the encoder's construction conventions.

## 0.2.1 (2026-08-25)

### Fixed
- **SCR decode**: a Modbus `Send` at `device_id=0` no longer decodes as `device_id=1` — SCR blobs elide fields at their class default, and Send's device_id default (0) differs from Receive's (1).
- **CSV writer**: a `count_up` with `.reset()` wired but `.down()` unused always dehydrates the empty `.down()` row, so the `.reset()` pin row directly follows the counter row even when the reset branch has a floating OR-leg below it.
- **CSV read**: rows after a counter/shift `.reset()` pin row stay below the instruction's span instead of being absorbed into it, which misplaced a floating OR-leg onto the unused `.down()` row.

### Added
- **Tests**: synthetic regression coverage for default-elided Send/Receive fields and for floating OR-leg rows below every pinned instruction span (timer, count_up, count_down, shift).

## 0.2.0

### Fixed
- **SCR decode**: correct the row-topology block framing — every row (including row 0) uses one uniform block format, fixing branch rungs whose wires (`T`/`|`/`-`) were silently dropped whenever a continuation row's first right-wired cell carried segment flag 1.
- **SCR decode**: accept placement-ordered flag-table entries — native captures store columns out of order (e.g. `[6,1,0,3,2,4,5]`), which the old sorted-order validation rejected.
- **SCR decode**: introduced deletion of presumed orphan wire rows above a later rail-connected row; the claimed native clipboard agreement was based on a synthetic fixture, and this behavior is reversed in 0.2.2.

### Changed
- **SCR decode**: replace the heuristic topology parser (leading-row guessing, count_down special cases, end-marker scanning) with a deterministic parser derived from the verified format — see `docs/internals/binary-format.md` §"SCR row-topology blocks" for the spec.
- **SCR decode**: `decode_program()` now parses rung records with a single forward cursor — comments, topology, and instructions are read from explicit lengths and counts instead of scanning for signatures, so comments attach to their own rung by construction and malformed files fail loudly with the byte offset (see §"SCR rung records" in the binary format doc).

### Added
- **Tumbler fixture**: 34 real Click programs (`tests/fixtures/tumbler/`), each pairing the internal `.scr` program file with a clipboard capture of the same program; `decode_program()` output is regression-tested byte-identical against the clipboard CSVs.
- **Devtools**: `compare_csv.py` normalizes `R` vs `R1`/`R2` rung markers before comparing, so scr-derived and clipboard-saved CSVs diff cleanly.

## 0.1.9

### Added
- **Time drums**: encode and decode all five time bases (`Tms`/`Ts`/`Tm`/`Th`/`Td`), plus jog and jump, matching event drums.
- **CSV writer**: `write_csv(path, rungs, index=True)` emits 1-based sequential rung markers (`R1`, `R2`, `R3`, …) instead of plain `R`; readers accept `R` optionally followed by digits, so indexed files still round-trip.

### Fixed
- **Drum decode**: single-step event and time drums now decode from `Scr*.tmp` files instead of falling back to `RawInstruction`.
- **Drum decode**: a stray NOP stranded on a drum's pin row is dropped instead of surfacing as a spurious `NOP` that broke `write_csv`.
- **CSV writer**: a tall instruction (drum, timer, counter, …) with a wire branch or content running below its body keeps its rows positional instead of collapsing the following rows up, fixing `WriterError`/lost geometry on those rungs.

### Performance
- `decode_program()` is ~48% faster — topology block scanning uses `bytes.find()` instead of byte-by-byte iteration, and hot loops cache `len(data)` and precomputed constants.
- `encode()` is ~35% faster — cell headers use a single pre-compiled `struct.Struct.pack` instead of 8 separate calls, and Math blobs use pre-computed empty slot bytes instead of 1000 per-instruction loop iterations.

## 0.1.8

### Fixed
- **CSV writer**: downgrade trailing blank row mismatch from error to warning
  when a tall instruction's stripped continuation absorbs extra blank rows on
  read-back — fixes `WriterError` on rungs with blank rows beyond an
  instruction's visual height

## 0.1.7

### Fixed
- **SCR decode**: skip pure vertical pass-through rows in implied modifier
  row fallback, preventing `|` → `T` and blank → `-` corruption on
  continuation rows
- **CSV converter**: recognize `Contact`/`CompareContact` objects with
  `wire_down=True` during wire hydration, not just bare string tokens

### Changed
- **SCR decode**: remove `_implied_modifier_row_offsets` fallback — SCR
  continuation row topology already encodes per-row horizontal connectivity
  explicitly, verified across 883 rungs in 47 SCR files

## 0.1.6

### Fixed
- **SCR decode**: replace backward/brute-force topology block scanning with a
  single forward pass, fixing false positive matches from flag-table tail bytes
  that caused spurious empty rungs with inflated row counts

## 0.1.5

### Changed
- **Encode**: remove AF summary block — Click accepts multi-AF rungs without
  it, eliminating complex gating logic
- **CSV**: consolidate tall-instruction padding into shared hydrate/dehydrate
  helpers in converter and writer

### Added
- **Devtools**: `combine_coverage.py` — combine random coverage fixtures into
  a single multi-row rung for paste smoke-testing
- **Devtools**: `coverage_golden.py` now regenerates all bins unconditionally

## 0.1.4

### Fixed
- **CSV**: preserve multi-row AF round-trips, including pinned/tall AF blocks
  away from row 0, multiple tall blocks in one rung, and generic tall
  continuation rows
- **SCR decode**: restore omitted wiring for generic tall AF continuation rows
- **CSV writer**: fail loudly when emitted CSV rows lose decoded rung
  semantics by reparsing writer output and checking for row, condition, or AF
  mismatches before writing to disk

## 0.1.3

### Fixed
- **RTF decode**: parse RTF comments structurally instead of regex-based
  stripping, handling nested groups, font/color tables, and style toggles
  correctly
- **RTF decode**: handle `\uN` unicode escape sequences (signed 16-bit) and
  validate `ansicpg1252` before decoding
- **CSV**: preserve quoted string literals in AF token positional args — e.g.
  `copy("d",TXT1)` no longer loses its quotes during parse
- **Search instruction**: store text-search operands with quotes end-to-end,
  removing the strip-on-decode/re-add-on-encode anti-pattern

### Added
- **Encode**: auto-sanitize non-ASCII characters (curly quotes, em-dashes,
  arrows, etc.) in rung comments before RTF conversion via NFKD normalization


## 0.1.2

### Fixed
- **Math**: preserve duplicate operands and normalize parenthesis spacing

## 0.1.1

### Fixed
- **Encode**: correct `row_span` for tall AF instructions and single-rung list
  routing
