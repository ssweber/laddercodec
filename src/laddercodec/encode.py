"""Ladder rung encoder — unified pipeline.

Definitions
-----------

Rung:
    One logical unit of ladder logic. A rung has 1..32 rows, each with
    31 condition columns (A..AE) and 1 output column (AF). The rung may
    also carry a single plain-text comment.

Row:
    A horizontal slice of the rung grid. Row 0 is the topmost visible
    row. The grid starts at absolute offset 0x0A60 with a stride of
    0x800 per row (32 columns x 64 bytes per cell).

Cell:
    A 64-byte (0x40) block within the grid. Addressed by (row, column).
    Contains wire flags, structural control bytes, and (for instruction-
    bearing rungs) stream-placement metadata.

Empty rung:
    All condition columns blank (""), AF blank. No wire flags set, no
    instruction stream. The simplest valid rung.

Wire topology:
    The arrangement of horizontal wires ("-"), vertical pass-throughs
    ("|"), and junction-down points ("T") across the condition grid.
    Encoded via three per-cell flag bytes: +0x19 (left), +0x1D (right),
    +0x21 (down). This is the structural skeleton that contacts and
    instructions are placed onto.

Condition:
    A contact or comparison instruction placed on a condition column.
    NOT supported in this version. Conditions set wire flags (like "-")
    and additionally write an instruction stream entry with a type
    marker, function code, and operand.

Instruction stream:
    Serialized instruction data in the payload region (0x0294+). Fields
    sit at stream-relative offsets from type markers (0x27XX). Operand
    strings are variable-length UTF-16LE, so each instruction shifts
    all downstream positions. NOT used in this version.

NOP:
    The simplest AF-column instruction. At most one per rung. Encoded
    via a minimal byte model: col31 +0x1D = 1 (all rows), plus col0
    +0x15 = 1 for non-first rows. For multi-row comment rungs, NOP in
    continuation stream records also requires col31 +0x19 = 1. Does
    not require an instruction stream entry.

Comment:
    Plain-text annotation on a rung. Stored as an RTF envelope (fixed
    prefix + cp1252 body + fixed suffix) in the payload region at
    0x0298, followed by a continuation stream (phase-A). Max 1400
    bytes. The comment does not live inside the cell grid — it occupies
    its own space in the payload region. For multi-row rungs, the
    comment adds an extra 0x1000 page to the buffer allocation.

Page:
    A 0x1000 (4096) byte allocation unit. A 1-row rung occupies 2
    pages (0x2000 = 8192 bytes). Additional rows add pages:
    page_count = ceil(rows / 2) + 1. A comment on a multi-row rung
    adds one more page for the terminal companion extent.

Header table:
    32 entries x 64 bytes starting at 0x0254. Entry N corresponds to
    column N. Contains the row-count word (+0x00/+0x01), column index
    (+0x0C), and family/context bytes (+0x05, +0x11, +0x17, +0x18)
    that are zero for wire-only rungs but become structural for
    instruction-bearing families.

Phase-A:
    A universal 0xFC8-byte continuation stream written immediately
    after the comment payload. Identical across all tested comment
    lengths. Provides structural scaffolding that Click expects after
    the RTF envelope. This is NOT cell grid data — it is stream data
    that happens to occupy addresses in the same range as the grid
    for short comments in small buffers.


Supported checklist
-------------------

Verified in Click (encode → paste → copy back → decode round-trip):

    [x] Empty rung, 1..32 rows
    [x] Wire topology, 1..32 rows (-, |, T in any valid position)
    [x] NOP on any row (with col0 +0x15 enable for non-first rows)
    [x] Plain comment, 1-row (empty, wire, NOP, max 1400 bytes)
    [x] Plain comment, 2-row (empty, NOP, wire incl. col-A, max 1324)
    [x] Plain comment, 3-row (empty, NOP, wire, mixed, max 1400)
    [x] Plain comment, 4..32 rows (wire combos, scaling)
    [ ] Styled comments (bold/italic/underline RTF; crashes under
        current model)
    [ ] Contacts (NO, NC, edge, comparison, immediate variants)
    [ ] Coils / AF instructions (out, latch, reset)
    [ ] Instruction stream placement


Pipeline steps
--------------

    1. Allocate — page-aligned buffer from row count
    2. Header + cell structure — deterministic per-cell fields
    3. Comment — optional payload + phase-A (must precede wire flags)
    4. Wire flags — condition token grid (columns A..AE)
    5. AF column — NOP via minimal tested byte model

Steps 1-2 are handled by synthesize_empty_multirow. Steps 3-5 are
applied on top. Comment (step 3) is applied before wire flags because
phase-A overlaps the cell grid region for short comments — writing
wires after ensures they are not clobbered.

Future extension points for contacts and instructions are marked with
"FUTURE:" throughout. The main areas are:

    - Header seed bytes (+0x05, +0x11, +0x17, +0x18, trailer 0x0A59)
      become context-sensitive per instruction family.
    - Cell +0x39 linkage bytes are required for instruction-bearing rungs.
    - Condition columns gain contact/comparison tokens with instruction
      stream data (type markers 0x27XX, UTF-16LE operands).
    - AF column gains coil/output instructions (out, latch, reset) with
      operand streams beyond the current NOP-only model.
    - Instruction stream placement lives in the payload region and shifts
      with operand length; a stream builder replaces _apply_comment.
    - Multi-row comments require synthesizing the extra page and its
      terminal companion extent (font descriptors, CJK fallback tables).

Dependencies:
    - empty_multirow.synthesize_empty_multirow (steps 1-2)
    - topology constants (steps 3-4)
    - comment_phase_a.bin resource file (step 3)

#   - Function codes (8193 out, 8195 latch, 8196 reset, plus immediate/range)
